      "Answer: The Inspector General within the Department of Justice (DOJ) is authorized to conduct investigations and issue reports related to criminal wrongdoing and administrative misconduct of DOJ employees, as well as the administration of programs and operations. They can investigate complaints or information concerning illegal activities, mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific dangers to public health and safety. The Inspector General has access to all necessary DOJ records and materials except in certain sensitive cases, can request information from any federal, state, or local agency, issue subpoenas for evidence, and employ necessary staff. Special Agents of the Office of the Inspector General are authorized to detect and assist in the prosecution of crimes, serve legal writs, arrest without warrant for certain offenses, seek and execute search and arrest warrants, carry firearms, and perform other law enforcement functions. The Inspector General also has confidentiality obligations to protect the identity of complainants during investigations and prohibitions against reprisals for employees making complaints or disclosing information, provided the information is not knowingly false.\n",

      "Answer: The MORE Act introduced by Representative Ken Calvert, which stands for Maximize Offshore Resource Exploration, is focused on offshore drilling, not marijuana legalization. The key provisions of the MORE Act introduced by Calvert include revoking the congressional moratorium on offshore drilling, allowing drilling starting 25 miles from the coastline, and enabling states to receive a significant percentage of royalties from offshore drilling leases, up to 75% or 90% if they agree to drilling within 25 miles of their coastline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political challenges faced by this MORE Act relate to environmental concerns, opposition from Democrats and certain coastal communities who worry about the potential risks of offshore drilling to marine ecosystems and tourism, and debates over the energy policy and priorities of the United States. At the time of the bill's introduction, no Democrats had signed on to it, which indicates partisan challenges. Additionally, Representative Calvert's bill was introduced at a time when there was a push from certain lawmakers to increase domestic energy production, which also opposed arguments related to climate change and renewable energy initiatives.\n",
